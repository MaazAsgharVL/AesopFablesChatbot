This project is a chatbot designed to interactively share and discuss Aesop's Fables. It uses the OpenAI API to generate responses and is containerized with Docker for streamlined setup and deployment.

## Prerequisites

- **Docker**: Make sure Docker is installed on your system. Refer to the [Docker installation guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) if needed.
- **OpenAI API Key**: Required to access OpenAIâ€™s language models. 

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the main project directory:
   ```bash
   cd AesopFablesChatbot/chat_bot-main
   ```

3. **Configure OpenAI API Key**:
   - Open the `r.sh` file.
   - On **line 17**, replace `'API_KEY'` with your actual OpenAI API key:
     ```bash
     -e OPENAI_API_KEY='your_openai_api_key'
     ```

## Project Setup

You'll need to use two terminals for the setup and operation of this chatbot.

### Terminal 1

1. Go to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd AesopFablesChatbot/chat_bot-main
   ```

2. Set executable permissions and start the setup script:
   ```bash
   chmod +x b.sh
   ./b.sh
   ```

3. Set executable permissions for `r.sh` and start the services:
   ```bash
   chmod +x r.sh
   ./r.sh rag
   ./r.sh api
   ```

### Terminal 2

1. Go to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd AesopFablesChatbot/chat_bot-main
   ```

2. Set executable permissions for `c.sh` and start it:
   ```bash
   chmod +x c.sh
   ./c.sh
   ```

## Running the Chatbot
