 THE SCORPION AND THE LADYBUG


  A Scorpion befriended a Ladybug who became a loyal companion
to him.  A time came when she struggled to cross a challenging
and dangerous river, and so the Scorpion offered to take her
to the other side on his back.  He had come to care for her
and promised he would never harm her. But, safely across the
river, he allowed his tail to dip upon her with its venomous
sting.  As she lay in greatest pain, she said, "... but, you
promised... why?" He shrugged and said, sadly, "Because it is
my Nature."


   Regardless of our wishes, or even our intent, 
 it is to our Nature alone that we will be faithful.
