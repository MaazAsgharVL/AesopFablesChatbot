  The Vixen and the Lioness


  A Vixen who was taking her babies out for an airing one balmy
morning, came across a Lioness, with her cub in arms. "Why such
airs, haughty dame, over one solitary cub?" sneered the Vixen. "Look
at my healthy and numerous litter here, and imagine, if you are
able, how a proud mother should feel." The Lioness gave her a
squelching look, and lifting up her nose, walked away, saying
calmly, "Yes, just look at that beautiful collection. What are they?
Foxes! I've only one, but remember, that one is a Lion."


      "Quality is better than quantity."
